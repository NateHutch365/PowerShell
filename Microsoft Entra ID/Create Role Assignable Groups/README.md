# Role-Assignable Security Groups Creation Script

This PowerShell script automates the creation of role-assignable security groups in Microsoft Azure using the Microsoft Graph API. Each group is created with the capability to be assigned roles, making it an essential tool for administrators managing Azure AD roles and permissions.

## Features

- **Automated Group Creation:** Streamlines the process of creating multiple security groups with role assignment capabilities.
- **Role-Assignable Groups:** Each created group has the 'IsAssignableToRole' property set to true.
- **Customizable Group Definitions:** Easily add or modify the group properties within the script.

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK:** The script requires the `Microsoft.Graph.Groups` module. It will be installed automatically if not present.
- **Administrator Permissions:** Execution requires Global Administrator or Privileged Administrator role in Azure AD due to the permissions needed for group creation and role assignment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure you have the necessary administrator permissions in Azure AD.
3. Run the script in PowerShell.

## Usage

Execute the script in a PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
.\CreateRoleAssignableGroups.ps1
